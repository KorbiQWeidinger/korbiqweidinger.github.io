<div style="text-align: center;">
Since the beginning of my carrier as a software developer in 2017 the concepts of <b>Clean Code</b> and <b>TDD</b> were preached to me.<br>
Ever since I worked hard to improve my skills and implement these concepts into my daily development tasks. <br>

Since 2018 I am working as a software developer next to acquiring a degree in Computer Science. <br>
I am currently doing my M.Sc. in Informatics @ TUM.

I've done remote work since 2019, as consultant, frontend-developer and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. <br>

I'm confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one coding problem at a time.
